# Coin Flip Decision Maker ðŸª™

**Today:** Holiday  
**Time:** 5 PM  
**Problem:** I'm confused between whether to watch *Deadpool* or *Kraven* movie.  
**Solution:** Don't stress over it, just flip the coin! 

And... that's how this site was born! 

### Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. Enter your decisions into the input fields:

2. Flip the coin and get the result:

## Features
- Enter two decisions and flip a coin to decide.
- Get a random result each time you flip the coin.
- **No more decision paralysis!**

## And now, you know what Iâ€™m going to watch...  
After the flip... *Deadpool* it is!
